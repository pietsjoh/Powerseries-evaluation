# Notes

Removing tauFrac from fitting reduces the uncertainty of the beta factor by a factor of 10.

Making the beta dependence of A and xi explicit also reduces the uncertainty of the beta factor by a factor of 10.

To further reduce the uncertainty an estimate of the threshold (how the intracavity photon number relates to the output power)

Test if threshold does make any sense.

output power = mean_photon_number x photon_energy x output_coupling_rate

test out speed comparison imports in __init__.py files

maybe less values for mean of mode wavelength and also use weighted mean

to estimate the uncertainty of the fixed xi parameter, do evaluate extreme cases or evaluate multiple in between

take threshold and q-factor from fixed xi fit

uncertainty of threshold is missing -> uncertainty of Q-factor will be higher
-> for 18 the threshold lies outside of the fitted range -> Q-factor cannot be estimated

something is odd for fixed xi at 14/15 Âµm (both have exact same value)
